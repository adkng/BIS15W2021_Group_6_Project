# Lean's analyses
How do flower age and sex affect the amount of nectar per flower?


## Note: NA's are removed
```{r}
nectar_perflower %>% 
  filter(flower_age!="NA", sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h!="NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=flower_age, y=sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "How Flower Age Affects the Amount of Nectar", x = "Flower Age", y = "Sugar Collected by Flower in 24 Hours (mg)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

Flowers that are not too young or not too old produce the most nectar. 




```{r}
nectar_perflower %>% 
  filter(flower_sex!="NA", sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h!="NA") %>% 
  group_by(flower_sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=flower_sex, y=sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "How Flower Sex Affects the Amount of Nectar", x = "Flower Sex", y = "Sugar Collected by Flower in 24 Hours (mg)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

Flowers that are hermaphrodite (have both male and female sex organs) produce the most nectar. 



```{r}
nectar_perflower %>% 
  filter(collection_hour!="NA", sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h!="NA") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=collection_hour, y=sugar_in_micrograms_flower_24h))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = "What Time Gives the Most Amount of Nectar?", x = "Collection Hour", y = "Sugar Collected by Flower in 24 Hours (mg)") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = "bold"),
        axis.text = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))
```

Flowers collected from about 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM produce the most nectar. Perhaps this is because it is generally quite sunny around this time. Therefore, pollinators likely come to the flowers most at around this time. 



"There is considerable concern over declines in insect pollinator communities and potential impacts on the pollination of crops and wildflowers."

### Main Question:
-Why are insect pollinator communities declining?

### Possible Analyses
1. Which habitats have the least and most amount of nectar per flower? Why?
2. Which months have the least and most amount of nectar per flower? Why?
2. How do temperature and humidity affect the amount of nectar per flower?
3. How do age, sex, and collection hour affect the amount of nectar per flower?
4. Why is there a discrepancy between sugar and sugar max?

-Which combinations of factors result in the least and most amount of nectar per flower? 
  (amount of nectar is correlated to amount of pollinators bc flowers use nectar to attract pollinators)
  
-what factors possibly contribute to the decline of pollinators?

-what steps can we take to minimize the loss of pollinator communities?
